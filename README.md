# Universal-Test-Management-System

The system was developed with Spring Boot, Angular and Jenkins. The project takes a
repository containing yaml tests configuration file parses it on the CI server through the CLI tool, sends
report to the backend about the test results, stores them in a database and exposes that information through REST
API. The frontend sends requests to the server and presents the information to the user.
